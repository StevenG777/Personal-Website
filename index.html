            I want to start my career in either data science or software 
            engineering (full stack) industry as I enjoy understanding
            how a specific machine or deep learning model works 
            mathematically or apply the models to solve real world problems,
            and also interested in how front end, back end and database
            interacts and how to create a web or mobile based applications.
